> I like thinking and finding the best solutions. I love sharing my knowledge and learning from others. I try to contribute to open source any time I can (I created this [gem](https://github.com/stevenbarragan/julia_builder) a couple of months ago). I make an effort to increase and maintain really good test coverage. I like to learn new things, new language, new paradigms. Fast learner. vim lover. Rubik's cube solver.
